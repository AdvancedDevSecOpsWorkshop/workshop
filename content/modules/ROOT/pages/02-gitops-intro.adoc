= The Power of GitOps with OpenShift GitOps(60 mins)

In this module you will understand how GitOps is used to manage cluster configuration and application deployments. This module
assumes you have some familiarity with Argo CD.

[#introduction]
== Introduction

In this module we will deploy the Coolstore Application followed by the Pipeline using a GitOps methodology.

GitOps is the process that is used to deploy and manage cluster configuration and application deployments. In GitOps, git
as the source of truth and the GitOps engine, OpenShift GitOps, reconciles what is stored in git with the state of the cluster.
This process is two-way, changes to git can be automatically reconciled to the cluster and direct, manual changes in the cluster
can be automatically reverted back to what is in git.

In this way GitOps provides a powerful way to manage state in Kubernetes clusters while addressing common issues like
configuration drift, change management and auditing.

OpenShift GitOps is included with a standard OpenShift or OpenShift Platform Plus subscription, it provides a fully supported GitOps engine
using the upstream link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD,window='_blank'] project. Argo CD is a popular
GitOps engine for Kubernetes that provides a variety of features to manage a GitOps environment including
the engine, a comprehensive user interface, etc.

[#deploying-application]
== Deploying Coolstore Application

In this section we will cover the basics of deploying an application with argocd using manifests in a git repository.

We will deploy the same coolstore application as previously, but this time we will do that using a GitOps approach.

=== Deploy Application with Manifests

A managed collection of manifests is known as an `Application` within Argo CD.
Therefore, you must define it as such using an
link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications[Application
CR (CustomResource)^] in order to have Argo CD apply these manifests in your
cluster.

Let's review the `Application` manifest used to deploy this application (found link:https://github.com/AdvancedDevSecOpsWorkshop/workshop/blob/main/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/coolstore-gitops.yaml[here,window="_blank"])
and break this down a bit:

.link:https://github.com/AdvancedDevSecOpsWorkshop/workshop/blob/main/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/coolstore-gitops.yaml[coolstore-gitops.yaml,window="_blank"]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: coolstore-app
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: user1-cicd
    name: in-cluster <1>
  project: user1 <2>
  source: <3>
    path: content/modules/ROOT/files/module-01
    repoURL: https://github.com/AdvancedDevSecOpsWorkshop/workshop.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
  syncPolicy: <4>
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
----
<1> The destination server is API endpoint for the cluster where Argo CD is
  running -- in this case, using the locally-resolveable URL for the cluster
<2> Here you're installing the application in Argo CD's `default` project
  (`.spec.project`).
[NOTE]
Argo CD's concept of a `Project` is different than OpenShift's. Here you're
installing the application in Argo CD's `default` project (`.spec.project`).
*NOT* OpenShift's default project.
<3> The manifest repo, and the path within it where the YAML resides.
<4> The `syncPolicy` is set to `automated`. It will automatically prune
  resources that have been removed from the Git repo, but will not automatically
  correct resources that deviate from the definition stored in the repo, i.e
  manual changes made using `oc` or `kubectl` will not be "healed".

You will create an Application by slightly modifying the provided example inline
using the command below:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USER/{user}/' ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/coolstore-gitops.yaml | oc apply -n {user}-argocd -f -
----

The newly created Application appears as a tile with the title `bgd-app` in the
Argo CD UI.

image::gitops-apps/coolstore-app.png[SampleApp]

Clicking on this tile takes you to the application details page. You may see it
as still progressing or fully synced.

image::gitops-apps/coolstore-app2.png[SampleApp]

At this point the application should be up and running. Verify that the
resources were created:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get all -n {user}-cicd
----

The output should list several things:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/catalog-database    1/1     1            1           16m

----


**Extra Credit:** Do you know why you have a ReplicaSet?

Wait for the rollout of the new pods to happen in the deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc rollout status deploy/inventory-quarkus -n {user}-cicd
----

If it is successful, you can now visit the deployed application in the browser.

From the OpenShift web console, select *{user}-cicd* Project from
drop-down menu, and use the _Topology_ view to find the link as you did with
the Argo CD console.

image::gitops-apps/coolstore-topology.png[coolstore App]

Alternatively, get the app Route from the CLI:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get route gateway-vertx -n {user}-cicd -o jsonpath='{"http://"}{.spec.host}{"\n"}'
----

WARNING: This route is only available via HTTP. If you try to visit via HTTPS,
you will get an _Application not available_ error. Do you know why that is?

=== Addressing Configuration Drift

Let's introduce a change in the application environment! Patch the live
Deployment manifest to change the color of the bubbles in the application from
blue to green:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]

----
oc -n {user}-cicd scale deploy inventory-quarkus --replicas=4
----

You can see that the pods will start to get created, but instantly get deleted again. This is because OpenShift GitOps is automatically setting the replicas number to 1, as specified in the application manifest for the quarkus-inventory deployment.

You can set up Argo CD to automatically correct drift by setting the `selfHeal`
property of the `Application` manifest to do so. Using the example from link:#_deploy_the_application[above]:

[.console-input]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# coolstore-gitops.yaml
...
spec:
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true # Set this to true
----

You can also manually sync your app via the Argo CD by:

* First clicking `SYNC`
* Then clicking `SYNCHRONIZE`

image::gitops-apps/coolstore-manual-sync.png[Manually Sync the application]

After the sync process is done, the Argo CD UI should mark the application as in
sync.

Or, as in our case, after the fact by running the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc patch application/coolstore-app -n {user}-argocd --type=merge -p='{"spec":{"syncPolicy":{"automated":{"prune":true,"selfHeal":true}}}}'
----

[#helm]
== Helm
include::_attributes.adoc[]

link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] is a package and install manager that standardises and
simplifies packaging and deployment of containerized applications with Kubernetes. Unlike Kustomize, which
uses a patching approach, Helm uses templating to enable users to tailor the deployed manifests
as required.

[#exploring-helm]
=== Exploring Helm

The principles of 'Helm' are as follows:

* A package manager for Kubernetes with applications packaged as charts
* Uses templates to enable applications to be configured per installation
* Parameters for the chart are held in a `values.yaml` file and consumed by the templates

image::gitops-apps/helm-logo.png[Helm Logo]

[#exploring-helm-cli]
=== Exploring the Helm CLI

Similar to Kustomize from the previous lab, the `helm` CLI should have been installed as part of the lab
setup. Verify that it has been installed.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
helm version --short
----

This should display the version, it should look something like this.

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{v3.9.0+3.el8+ge09b16a}
----

Helm as a package manager can be used to install a Helm chart into a kubernetes cluster
and can then manage the lifecycle of the application including upgrades and uninstalling the
application. However Helm can also render the chart as pure yaml without installing the
application in a cluster.

Argo CD follows a philosophy of managing manifests and as a result it interacts with Helm by
having Helm templating the chart. It does not install the chart in a Kubernetes cluster. The
lifecycle of a Helm chart in Argo CD is managed by updating the version of the chart Argo CD is
using and having Argo CD render the new version of the chart.

As a result for the purpose of this workshop we will be focusing on the `helm template`
command rather than `helm install`.

[#exploring-helm-charts]
=== Deploying Application with Helm

In this section we will explore the chart that we will be deploying into the cluster using GitOps.
This chart will be used to deploy the same application we did previously with Kustomize. We will work
with a chart in the
`content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/globex-ui` directory within the
repository you cloned.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd
cd ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/globex-ui
----

Next if you run the `ls` command you should see two files: `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml`, as well
as a directory called templates. Let's have a look at these in more detail.

.link:https://github.com/AdvancedDevSecOpsWorkshop/workshop/blob/main/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/globex-ui/Chart.yaml[Chart.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$globex-ui/Chart.yaml[]
----

This file is the link:https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file[chart definition] which specifies name, version and other characteristics of the chart.

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/master/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-helm-chart/values.yaml[values.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$globex-ui/values.yaml[]
----

The `values.yaml` file is the default set of values that will be used by the chart. When templating or installing the chart
you can provide your own values.yaml to override some or all of these defaults as needed for a specific use case.

Notice that since this is a yaml file parameters can be hierarchical which enables grouping related parameters together as shown
by the `gitea` section.

The templates/ directory is where template files reside. When Helm assesses a chart, it processes all files in the templates/ directory using the template rendering engine. The results of these templates are then gathered and forwarded to Kubernetes.You can learn more about templating link:https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/[here].

[#helm-template]
=== Helm Template

In this section, we will explore how to use the `helm template` command to generate Kubernetes manifests from a Helm chart. This command is a fundamental tool for understanding how Helm charts work and for visualising the resources they create.

==== Step 1: Run the Helm template Command

Execute the following command to render the chart template from your local directory and display the output on the screen:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
helm template globex-ui ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/globex-ui
----

==== Step 2: View the Output


After running the command, you will see the output of the `helm template` command, which represents the generated Kubernetes manifest files. Below is an example of what you can expect to see:

You will see the output of the `helm template`, which is lengthy, so this is just an excerpt:

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----

[#helm-charts-deploy-applications]
=== Using Helm charts to deploy applications in Argo CD

In this section, we will utilise Helm charts to deploy applications within Argo CD. Helm charts provide a convenient way to manage and deploy Kubernetes applications. We will first examine the configuration file for an Argo CD Application that deploys a Helm chart for the BGD app. This file contains essential configuration details such as the destination, source, project, and sync policy.

==== Step 1: View the Argo CD Application Configuration


To view the YAML configuration file for the Argo CD Application, execute the following command:


[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/pipeline-helm-app.yaml
----

You should see the following output:


.link:https://github.com/AdvancedDevSecOpsWorkshop/workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/pipeline-helm-app.yaml[pipeline-helm-app.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$pipeline-helm-app.yaml[]
----

This YAML configuration defines an Argo CD Application named "pipeline-helm" that deploys a Helm chart from a specific Git repository to the "{user}-cicd" namespace.

==== Step 2: Deploy/Observe the Argo CD Application


Apply the configuration in the file to create the Argo CD Application in the namespace {user}-argocd. This application will deploy the Helm chart for the pipeline app:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USER/{user}/' ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/pipeline-helm-app.yaml |  oc apply -f - -n {user}-argocd
----

In the ArgoCD interface you should see the successful deployment of the "pipeline-helm" application.

image::gitops-helm/pipeline-helm-app.png[]

Now click on the "bgd-helm" application. We will explore its deployment. You can tell by the icon that it's deployed via a Helm chart from a Git repository. Although you could deploy it through a Helm repository, we're using a Git repository for this demonstration.

Access the application details by clicking on the "App Details" option.

image::gitops-helm/pipeline-helm-app2.png[]

Next, click on "Parameters." You will notice that there is no separate values file as the application is deployed directly from the Helm chart.

All the files are now deployed in the {user}-cicd namespace, and you can see the full pipeline by accessing Pipelines -> pipelines in the console, as shown below:

image::gitops-helm/pipeline-view.png[]

[#custom-values-files]
=== Custom values files

In this section we explore the use of custom values files with Helm charts. These allow you to tailor deployments to your specific needs. Custom values files offer the flexibility to override default settings without modifying the chart directly.

==== Step 1: Explore the Custom Values Configuration


Begin by examining a YAML file named "pipeline-helm-app-custom.yaml." This file closely resembles the previous configuration but introduces a critical difference: it references a custom values file stored in the same Git repository as the Helm chart.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/gitops/helm/pipeline-helm-app-custom.yaml
----

You will notice a section in this YAML file that defines the name and path of the custom values file responsible for adjusting the Helm chart's default settings:

[.console-output]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----

    helm:
      valueFiles:
        - custom_values_1/values.yaml
----

This configuration specifies how Helm accesses and uses the custom values file to modify the Helm chart's behaviour.

==== Step 2: Explore the Custom Values File


Examine the custom values file that is being referenced:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/examples/globex-ui/custom_values_1/values.yaml
----

You should see that it defines specific values for some of the parameters in the chart, using this specific values file.

==== Step 3: Apply the Custom Values

Now, apply the custom values file to the initial application using Argo CD:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USER/{user}/' ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/examples/pipeline-helm-app-custom.yaml | oc apply -f - -n {user}-argocd
----

==== Step 4: Verify the Changes

Return to ArgoCD and click on "App Details," then navigate to the "Parameters" section, where you previously made changes. You’ll notice that the custom value file has been successfully added, and it has updated the values to display the animated balls in green.

image::gitops-helm/custom-values.png[]

Using ArgoCD to deploy a Helm chart with custom values files offers the advantage of tailoring and overriding the chart’s default settings, all without needing to alter the chart directly. This flexibility enables you to deploy the chart with different configurations to suit various environments or specific use cases.

[#parameter_values]
=== Argo CD Application with Parameter Values

In this section, we'll explore a YAML file where parameter values are embedded directly within the Application, eliminating the need for separate values files.

==== Step 1: Examine the Parameterised Configuration

Begin by examining the YAML file named "pipeline-helm-app-para.yaml." This file, similar to the previous configurations, defines an Argo CD Application for deploying a Helm chart. However, a notable difference is the inclusion of all desired parameter values directly within the YAML file:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cat ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/examples/pipeline-helm-app-para.yaml
----

.link:https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-gitops-workshop/blob/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/examples/bgd-app-helm-para.yaml[bgd-app-helm-para.yaml,window='_blank']
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$pipeline-helm-app-para.yaml[]
----

In the 'parameters' section of the YAML, you will notice that we have included all the desired values direcly within the chart.

This approach allows us to apply these settings directly to Argo CD without relying on external values files.

==== Step 2: Apply the Parameterised Configuration

Apply this parameterised configuration to Argo CD:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
sed 's/$USER/{user}/' ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/examples/pipeline-helm-app-para.yaml | oc apply -f - -n {user}-argocd
----

Return to the ArgoCD interface and navigate to the 'App Details' section. Click on 'Parameters.' You will notice that the custom values file, which was present in the previous example, has been successfully removed from the ArgoCD Application.

image::gitops-helm/helm-parameters.png[]

Deploying a Helm chart through ArgoCD with integrated parameters allows you to customise default settings without modifying the chart itself or relying on external values files. This centralises configuration management across different environments.

==== Step 4: Make Further Adjustments

To make changes to the parameters, simply click on the 'Edit' button. Feel free to explore and make adjustments as desired during the workshop.

[#helm-conclusion]
=== Conclusion: Helm on ArgoCD

In this module we learned how to deploy Helm charts using Argo CD and we looked at the different ways in Argo CD to pass parameters to the Helm chart. A brief summary of the Pros and Cons of the approaches we examined can be summarised as follows:

|===
|*Custom Values File - Pros* | *Built-in Parameters - Pros*
|Customise Configurations:Create a separate values.yaml file to tailor configurations for different environments. Override default values in the chart’s values.yaml file with your specific settings.|Environment-specific YAML: Manage YAML configurations for each environment using branches or tags.
| Rapid Modification: External values files provide an advantage over managing multiple Helm charts with individual values.
Facilitates quick modification of multiple values through a single file change.|No reliance on external values files makes local testing and debugging with `helm template` and `helm lint` easier.
|*Custom Values File - Cons*|*Built-in Parameters - Cons*
|Manual Updates: Requires manual updates to the values file, deviating from the default Helm charts behaviour.|Customisation Limitations: Limited customisation options due to YAML file constraints.
|Potential for errors or inconsistencies if the values file and chart configurations do not align.|Necessitates a separate chart for each environment, potentially leading to redundancy.
|===

You can read more about the patterns for deploying Helm charts with Argo CD link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2023/05/25/3-patterns-deploying-helm-charts-argocd[here].

In conclusion, this module introduced Helm as a Kubernetes package manager with templating capabilities. We explored its usage in ArgoCD, focusing on rendering Helm charts as pure YAML and customising deployments with custom values and parameter values for flexible configuration management. This approach streamlines the deployment process and enables customised configurations without altering the Helm chart directly.
