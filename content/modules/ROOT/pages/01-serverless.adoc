Fig 1. The image shows an Overview of OpenShift as an Application Platform.

* Built on the *trusted* foundation of *Red Hat Enterprise Linux*, *Red Hat OpenShift* provides a flexible, scalable foundation for modern application development across hybrid cloud environments—including onsite infrastructure, public cloud resources, and edge devices.

* *Red Hat OpenShift* provides a *comprehensive application platform* that helps streamline secure, scalable development across varied environments, addressing modernization and deployment hurdles and boosting developer productivity and operational efficiency with extensive tooling and services.

* *Red Hat OpenShift* gives developers, operations and platform engineers a single, *consistent* user experience and the freedom to quickly build and deploy apps anywhere using the tools they want anywhere, whether they are on-premise, on a public cloud, at the edge, or using a hybrid infrastructure.


== Exploring OpenShift as an Application Platform from the OpenShift console

In this section we will explore some of the capabilities discussed such as *Image Build*, *Runtimes*, *Serverless* and *CI/CD*.

*Red Hat OpenShift* allows you to use the *Developer perspective* to build applications and associated components and services, define how they work together, and monitor their health over time.


=== Working with UBI Images

Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) are OCI-compliant container base operating system images with complementary runtime languages and packages that are freely redistributable. https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image[(Re)Introducing the Red Hat Universal Base Image^]

The Developer perspective allows you to select a UBI image to be used as a base image for the new applications that will be built and deployed in OpenShift.


=== *Working with Serverless*
The serverless cloud computing model provides developers with a modern, cloud-native app dev stack for hybrid clouds. Serverless lets developers focus on their code without worrying about the infrastructure. Red Hat® OpenShift® Serverless allows you to avoid being locked into a single vendor and enables a multicloud approach.  *Red Hat OpenShift Serverless*, based on the open-source *Knative project*, is your bridge to streamlined, efficient, and scalable event-driven cloud-native app development. *Knative* has two main components *Knative Serving* and *Knative Eventing*.

=== *Benefits of Serverless*

- Simplified cloud native development
- Automatic scaling
- Multi-cloud portability
- Comprehensive integration
- Built-in security
- Enterprise-grade application platform


=== *Knative Eventing*

image::ocp-app/serverless_types.png[width=100%]


* https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/latest/about/about-knative-serving.html[Knative Serving^] allows you to create Knative services and functions on your cluster. It also allows you to use additional functionality such as autoscaling and networking options for your applications.

* With https://docs.openshift.com/serverless/latest/about/about-knative-eventing.html[Knative Eventing^] you can create Knative components such as event sources, brokers, and channels and then use them to send events to applications or external systems.

=== *Knative Serving*

== Modernize applications using OpenShift Web Console

=== Application Overview

- *Web NodeJS*: The application recently created is the UI enabling users to interact with the coolstore.
- *Gateway-vertx*: A Java application that works as a gateway between the UI and the rest of the application services.
- *Inventory*: A Java-based application built with Quarkus that provides the inventory information for each specific product. The data is shown in the UI as to how much quantity is available on each product.
- *Catalog*: A Java-based application built with Spring Boot that connects with the Catalog Database to provide all the catalog information. The catalog data will not be visible in the UI without this service.

== Building a Serverless application with the OpenShift Application Platform

=== Access the OpenShift Web Console

You can access the OpenShift Console at the following URL:

link:{openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url},window='_blank']

You will see a login screen with two options, select the *Keycloak* option.

image::ocp-app/openshift_login.png[width=80%]

[IMPORTANT]
If you accidentally login with the `htpasswd_provider` option then you will not be
able to login to OpenShift with Keycloak. Please ask your instructor
to correct it by deleting the OpenShift user and identity before logging in again
with Keycloak.

You will be redirected to Keycloak, use your credentials to login:

* user: {user}

* password: openshift

Once you have logged in you will be redirected back to the OpenShift Console.

=== Log in the OpenShift using the terminal:

Since we are using Keycloak SSO you will need to copy the CLI login
command from the console. To do so, click on your user name in
the upper right corner and select `Copy login command`

image::ocp-app/copy_login_command.png[width=80%]

This will redirect you to Keycloak to login with your credentials:

* user: {user}

* password: openshift

Once you have logged in you will see a page with a link `Display Token`, click
the link to view the token. Copy the oc login command as per below and paste
it into the terminal.

image::ocp-app/oc_login_command.png[width=80%]

[NOTE]
In later versions of OpenShift you can avoid this process by using `oc login --web <openshift-api-url>`. This
will start a web server running on localhost to handle the OIDC redirect process. Unfortunately in this
workshop since we are running the terminal inside a pod there is no way for Keycloak to redirect back to
the terminal in the pod hence we use the "Copy login command" flow in this workshop.

=== Create your project

* Create a new project to deploy the {app_name}. Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc new-project coolstore-dev-{user}
----

* Clone the project to access the files.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
git clone -b main --single-branch https://gitea-gitea.{subdomain}/user1/workshop ~/workshop
----

* Explore the yaml file that will deploy the catalog and the database.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cd ~/workshop/content/modules/ROOT/files/module-01
----

* Install the the Coolstore components:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc apply -f coolstore.yaml
----
[.console-output]
[source,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
output:
    deployment.apps/gateway-vertx created
    service/gateway-vertx created
    route.route.openshift.io/gateway-vertx created
    deployment.apps/inventory-quarkus created
    service/inventory-quarkus created
    serviceaccount/catalog-app created
    secret/catalog-database created
    deployment.apps/catalog-database created
    service/catalog-database created
----

=== Explore the topology view
The Topology view in the Developer perspective of the web console provides a visual representation of all the applications within a project, their build status, and the associated components and services.

==== Review the set of microservices that composed the Coolstore application

** Click on *Topology* to access the Developer's Perspective

image::ocp-app/coolstore_topology.png[width=80%]

All the components shown are deployments, which are in charge of managing your application. They are all in blue, indicating that the application is running. The arrows will indicate which components are connected.

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/applications/odc-viewing-application-composition-using-topology-view.html[For more information^]

As you can see, everything is there except the UI and the catalog. In the next section, you will be moving the UI into OpenShift.

=== Import the application

*Congratulations* you build and deploy a new application into OpenShift in just a few clicks!

[#building_a_backend_application_using_the_openshift_application_platform_with_openshift_pipelines]
== Building a backend application using the OpenShift Application Platform with OpenShift Pipelines

In this section, you will move the catalog Java Spring Boot application into OpenShift using the Developer Perspective. OpenShift will create an automated CI/CD pipeline and all the manifests required by the application.


=== *CI/CD with OpenShift Pipelines*

Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines is a cloud-native, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) solution based on Kubernetes resources. It uses Tekton building blocks to automate deployments across multiple platforms by abstracting away the underlying implementation details. Tekton introduces a number of standard custom resource definitions (CRDs) for defining CI/CD pipelines that are portable across Kubernetes distributions.


https://docs.openshift.com/pipelines/latest/about/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[OpenShift Pipelines^] provides a Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework to design and run each step of the CI/CD pipeline in its own container. It can scale independently to meet the on-demand pipelines with predictable outcomes.

=== OpenShift Pipeline Concepts

* *Task* resources are the building blocks of a pipeline and consist of sequentially executed steps. It is essentially a function of inputs and outputs.

* *Steps* are a series of commands that are sequentially executed by the task and achieve a specific goal, such as building an image.

* *Task Run* An invocation of a task with inputs and outputs

image::ocp-app/task_run.png[width=80%]

* *Pipeline Resource* Inputs and outputs to tasks and pipelines (git, image, etc)
* *Pipeline* A graph of tasks executed in a certain order
* *Pipeline Run* An invocation of a pipeline with inputs and outputs

image::ocp-app/pipeline_run.png[width=80%]

[#conclusion]
== Conclusion

With the Developer Perspective, you can create, build, and manage applications or the command line. The Developer perspective is a powerful tool that enables you to move applications from a Git repository, helm chart, jar file, and much more.
*Serverless* allows the deployment of applications without the burden of operations. The application's pods will be created depending on how much traffic is received. Serverless is a way to save costs since the applications will only run when receiving traffic.
*OpenShift Pipelines* allows teams to build and deploy applications via CI/CD. Pipelines can be autogenerated when selecting the The pipelines checkbox can be enhanced considering your organization's requirements and guidelines.
