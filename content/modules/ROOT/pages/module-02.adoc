= The Power of GitOps with OpenShift GitOps(60 mins)

In this module you will understand how GitOps is used to manage cluster configuration and application deployments. This module
assumes you have some familiarity with Argo CD.

== Introduction

GitOps is the process that is used to deploy and manage cluster configuration and application deployments. In GitOps, git
as the source of truth and the GitOps engine, OpenShift GitOps, reconciles what is stored in git with the state of the cluster.
This process is two-way, changes to git can be automatically reconciled to the cluster and direct, manual changes in the cluster
can be automatically reverted back to what is in git.

In this way GitOps provides a powerful way to manage state in Kubernetes clusters while addressing common issues like
configuration drift, change management and auditing.

OpenShift GitOps is provided with OpenShift at no additional cost, it provides a fully supported GitOps engine
using the upstream link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD,window='_blank'] project. Argo CD is a popular
GitOps engine for Kubernetes that provides a variety of features to manage a GitOps environment including
the engine, a comprehensive user interface, etc.

== OpenShift GitOps Architecture

In this section we will do a brief overview of the OpenShift GitOps architecture which is depicted in the diagram below.

image::gitops/argocd-architecture.png[]

In the diagram above, everything contained within the dotted is running in OpenShift whereas outside the line are external
dependencies or interactions.

The OpenShift GitOps operator is used to deploy, manage and upgrade an installation of Argo CD which runs in a
specified namespace. The Argo CD installation contains several components, running as individual deployments,
which are as follows:

1. *Application Controller*. This component is responsible for deploying and monitoring Kubernetes resources,
as a result it interacts with the Kubernetes API.
2. *Repo Server*. This component manages access to the manifests via a git repository, it is responsible for
fetching the manifests (i.e. yaml files). These manifests can be built from raw yaml, helm or kustomize but
additional tools can be used via a plugin architecture. For improved performance, it caches these manifests
in the redis component.
3. *Server*. This provides the user interface as well as a REST API.
4. *Dex (optional)*. Provides authentication via OpenShift OAuth2, in this workshop it is not used as we
are authenticating directly against Keycloak.
5. *ApplicationSet Controller (Not shown)*. This component is responsible for managing ApplicationSets which
are used to generate Applications using generators. These generators can create Applications based on Pull Requests,
directories in git, clusters, etc.

== Workshop Architecture

In this workshop, two GitOps instances have been deployed as follows:

1. Cluster GitOps. This is used by the platform team to manage cluster configuration as well as
cluster-scoped tenant resources (i.e. Namespaces, Quotas, Networkpolicy, Operators, etc). It has cluster-admin
level Kubernetes privileges in order to manage cluster configuration.

2. Shared GitOps. This instance is used by application teams to deploy their applications. This is a shared
GitOps environment with multiple application teams accessing it. As a result Argo CD Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) has been
configured to manage access so that users from different teams cannot view or modify other teams applications. Additionally
it has much less Kubernetes privileges then the Cluster GitOps instance possesses.

=== Cluster GitOps

By default the OpenShift GitOps operator will install an instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, this instance
is cluster-scoped and users are encouraged to use this instance for cluster configuration including managing
privileged resources on behalf of tenants (Namespaces, Quotas, Operators, etc).

Lets have a brief look at this instance first, to do so access the OpenShift Application Menu and select the Cluster Argo CD
item highlighted in red:

image::gitops/openshift-app-menu-cluster-argocd.png[]

This will take you to the Argo CD user interface for this instance, to login click the Keycloak button shown in red:

image::gitops/argocd-keycloak-login.png[]

Assuming you have already logged into OpenShift with Keycloak you will be automatically logged into Argo CD since
we are using Keycloak to provide Single-Sign-On in this workshop. Once you are logged in you will see the following
applications:

image::gitops/argocd-cluster-users.png[]

Notice how you can view all of the user projects (user1, user2, user3, etc), this is because we have used Argo CD RBAC
to provide users in the `developers` group with limited access to the Argo CD Project that these applications are tied to.

[Note]
It is uncommon for developers to have any access to the cluster scoped instance which is typically managed by the platform
team, we are providing it here for illustrative purposes. In situations where it is beneficial for high performing
developer teams to have limited access typically that access would be limited to Applications that are specific
to that team. (i.e. user1 could only see the user1 application, etc)

Select the app for your particular user called `user{user}`. Depending on the number of users attending the workshop there
could be a lot of Applications, you can find your application by using the filter bar:

image::gitops/argocd-filter.png[]

Once you find the Application, click on it to view all of the resources that this Application deployed. This Application
is provisioning all of the resources that a tenant, i.e. your user, requires on this cluster including namespaces, rolebindings,
etc. These are the resources that the platform team, i.e. cluster-admins, need to provision for developer teams on the
cluster.

image::gitops/cluster-argocd-user-app.png[]

You can view the groups associated with your logged in user by clicking on the user button, note the `developers`
group that is shown along with the team, `teamX`, that your user is associated with. In our scenario user1 is on
team 1, user2 on team2, etc. The `developers` group is a catch all group that all of the users belong to.

These groups are provisioned in Keycloak and made available to Argo CD when you logged into the application.

In the next section we will review the Shared Argo CD instance and do a deeper dive afterwards on how Argo CD RBAC is configured
to determine the access that users have to resources in Argo CD. For now know that you have limited permissions
on the Applications in the `Users` project, only Get and Sync permissions have been enabled.

[Note]
There is another Argo CD Project deployed here for cluster configuration for which the Developers group has no
permissions, If at the end of the workshop you would like to see how the Workshop was configured using GitOps
you can ask the instructor to enable visibility.


=== Shared GitOps

The Shared GitOps instance is the Argo CD instance that developer teams will interact with. Compared to the
Cluster GitOps instance it has much less privileges on the cluster and are more aligned with developer
team responsibilities around deploying applications.

[Note]
While technically a single Argo CD instance can be used for both cluster configuration and developer deployments
by leveraging Argo CD RBAC, it is recommended that these use cases be in separate instances to minimize the possibilities
of privilege escalation. Privilege escalation can occur if there is a hole in the Argo CD RBAC configuration enabling
a developer team member to leverage the higher kubernetes permissions a cluster configuration GitOps instance would have,

Login into the Shared GitOps instance by using the link in the OpenShift application menu:

image::gitops/openshift-app-menu-shared-argocd.png[]

The login process is identical to the Cluster GitOps instance, click the Keycloak login button to complete the process. Once logged
in a set of Applications will be displayed:

image::gitops/shared-gitops-apps.png[]

Note in the Shared GitOps, unlike the Cluster GitOps instance, you can only view Applications that are specific to your user.

We have a single `dev-tools` Application deployed which has deployed Sonarqube and Nexus which will be used in the Pipelines
module of this workshop. If you check with your neighbors, assuming they have reached this section, you will note that
every person has their own dev-tools Application which is unique to that workshop user. How can we have an Application
with the same name multiple times in the same Argo CD instance?

We are going to look at this and RBAC in more depth in the subsequent sections.

== Deep Dive

=== Argo CD CLI

We wil use the ArgoCD CLI to explore the Shared GitOps in more detail. A secret has been pre-created in the `user{user}-argocd`
namespace called `argocd-cli` that provides the credentials needed to login into Argo CD.

[Note]
Normally when using Argo CD with OIDC the login would be done with using the `--sso` switch
which starts up a local web server to handle the OIDC callback on localhost. However since
our terminal is running in OpenShift a local account, `user{user}-cli` has been pre-created
with identical permissions to the SSO user. Normally local accounts in Argo CD should only
be used for automation not for users.

To provision secret into the terminal as exported environment variables run the following
commands:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
export ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN=$(oc get secret argocd-cli -n user1-argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN}" | base64 -d)
export ARGOCD_SERVER=$(oc get secret argocd-cli -n user1-argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.ARGOCD_SERVER}" | base64 -d)
export ARGOCD_USERNAME=$(oc get secret argocd-cli -n user1-argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.ARGOCD_USERNAME}" | base64 -d)
alias argocd='f(){ argocd "$@" --grpc-web;  unset -f f; }; f'
----

The Argo CD CLI will use the specified environment variables automatically and not require an explicit login. Additionally
the alias command at the end will ensure that when the `argocd` is called the parameter `--grpc-web` is automatically added. since
we are routing commands through the OpenShift Route this parameter is needed to avoid superfluous warnings.

[Note]
If you restart the terminal interface you may need to run the above commands again in order to access Argo CD
from the command line.

Test the variables are set by using the Argo CD CLI to view the Applications that were shown in the user interface:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]

The following output will be provided showing the application name, the sync and health status, the source and destination.

In addition to retrieving information about the Application, various tasks can be performed via the CLI including syncing, refreshing and modifying the Application. We
will look at these in more depth in subsequent sections.

=== Argo CD Projects

Argo CD link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/[Projects,window='_blank'] are used to group Applications together as well as manage
permissions to the Applications and other Project scoped resources. They are basically useful when managing a multi-tenant Argo CD as the Project not
only determines the user permissions but also the permissions of the Applications it is managing in terms of Kubernetes access. As per the
documentation, an Argo CD Project can:

* restrict what may be deployed (trusted Git source repositories)
* restrict where apps may be deployed to (destination clusters and namespaces)
* restrict what kinds of objects may or may not be deployed (e.g. RBAC, CRDs, DaemonSets, NetworkPolicy etc...)
* defining project roles to provide application RBAC (bound to OIDC groups and/or JWT tokens)

In our Shared GitOps instance each workshop team, and thus user, has their own Project to manage access and restrictions for their Applications. To
view your teams project, use the CLI to run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd proj list
----

Notice that a single project is listed:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME   DESCRIPTION    DESTINATIONS    SOURCES  CLUSTER-RESOURCE-WHITELIST  NAMESPACE-RESOURCE-BLACKLIST  SIGNATURE-KEYS  ORPHANED-RESOURCES

----

A detailed view of the project is retrieved by using the `get` command:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd proj get {user}
----

[.console-output]

Orphaned Resources:          disabled
----

Some resources, such as clusters and repositories, can be scoped globally or at a Project level. Scoping resources
at a Project level can be useful in cases where the Argo CD administrator would like to enable self-service
for application teams. In this workshop these resources are defined globally however if you would like to learn
more about this capability the Argo CD documentation covers this topic in depth.

link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/projects/#project-scoped-repositories-and-clusters[Project scoped Repositories and Clusters,window="_blank"]

=== Role Based Access Control

Argo CD has it's own Role Based Access Control (RBAC) that is separate and distinct from Kubernetes RBAC. When users interact
with Argo CD via the Argo CD UI, CLI or API the Argo CD RBAC is enforced. If users interact with Argo CD resources directly
using the OpenShift Console or kubectl/oc then only the Kubernetes RBAC is used.

Additionally the application-controller in Argo CD, as shown previously in the GitOps Architecture, interacts with the
Kubernetes API and is governed by Kubernetes RBAC. Argo CD can only deploy and manage the Kubernetes resources that
the application-controller has been given permission to use in Kubernetes RBAC,

This relationship is shown in the following diagram:

image::gitops/argocd-rbac.png[]

The Argo CD RBAC is implemented using the link:https://casbin.org/docs/overview[Casbin, window="_blank"] library. Permissions
are defined by creating roles and then assigning those roles to groups, or individual users, as needed. Argo CD includes
two roles out of the box:

* role:readonly - provides read-only access to all resources
* role:admin - allows unrestricted access to all resources

Roles and permissions can be defined in two places, globally and on a per Project basis. It is recommended that tenant
roles and permissions be defined in the Project and global roles be reserved for Argo CD administrators and managing
globally scoped resources.

As a user of the workshop you do not have access to view the global configuration, however this is what is defined:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
  policy.csv: |
    p, role:none, *, *, */*, deny
    g, system:cluster-admins, role:admin
    g, cluster-admins, role:admin
    p, role:developers, clusters, get, *, allow
    p, role:developers, repositories, get, *, allow
    g, developers, role:developers
  policy.default: role:none
  scopes: '[accounts,groups,email]'
----

A few items to note about this global configuration:

* The first section is policies where we define roles and matching groups
** We are defining an explicit role, `role:none`, that denies all permissions.
** Users in the `cluster-admins` group are assigned to the `admin` role.
** We define a role for developers that grants read access to global resources like clusters and repositories.
** We assign the `developers` role to the `developers` group.
* Next the `policy.default` is set to `role:none` so that users are denied access to resources by default with permissions needing to be explicitly enabled.
* Scopes are set to include accounts, groups and email. Argo CD uses OIDC for authentication and this
matches OIDC link:https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ScopeClaims[scopes, window="_blank"], scopes selected
here can be used to match groups in the policy section.

[Note]
You can also set the `policy.default` to an empty string however the author of this workshop personally
prefers defining a role to minimize possible confusion with regards to intent.

Now let's look at the RBAC defined in the Project that has been setup for your team and user:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd proj role list {user}
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
ROLE-NAME  DESCRIPTION
admin      Team1 admins
pipeline   Pipeline accounts
----

This shows that two roles are defined, `admin` and `pipeline`. The `admin` role is intended for
users who will administer Applications in this Project. The `pipeline` role is intended
for automation tools and will be used by OpenShift Pipelines in a later module.

Now look at the `admin` role:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd proj role get {user} admin
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
Role Name:     admin
Description:   Team1 admins
Policies:
p, proj:user1:admin, projects, get, {user}, allow
p, proj:user1:admin, applications, *, {user}/*, allow
p, proj:user1:admin, exec, create, {user}/*, allow
g, team1, proj:{user}:admin
g, user1-cli, proj:{user}:admin
p, proj:{user}:pipeline, projects, get, {user}, allow
p, proj:{user}:pipeline, applications, get, {user}/*, allow
p, proj:{user}:pipeline, applications, sync, {user}/*, allow
g, {user}-pipeline, proj:{user}:pipeline
----

Here we can see information about the role including policies, let's break
down the first policy into it's constituent parts to understand how it is defined.

image::gitops/argocd-policy.png[]

1. The letter `p` indicates that a policy is being defined, this is how we assign
permissions to roles.
2. Next is the role of which this policy will be part of. In this case
it is scoped to Project `user1` and the role `admin`.
3. Then the resource type for which we are giving permissions to, in this case `projects`. Various
Argo CD resource types are supported including `applications`, `clusters`, and
link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions[more, window="_blank"].
4. After resource we define the actions for the policy, in this case a single action of `get`. Many
different link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions[actions, window="_blank"]
are available. A wildcard of `*` can be used which indicates all actions.
5. Next is the specific resource, this can be a wildcard like `*` for all resources or a named resource such as `user1` in this case
indicating the `user1` Project. For resources like Applications that are scoped to Projects a notation of
`<Project>/<Application>` can be used as shown in subsequent lines.
6. Finally whether we are allowing or denying the permission.

Once we have defined our role via policies we can then assign the policy to a group, this is indicated
by a `g` at the start of the line. For example, the line `g, team1, proj:user1:admin` indicates we
are assigning the project scoped role `admin` to the group `team1`.

Note that what is considered a `group` for matching purposes is controlled by the `scope` that was
reviewed earlier. While `groups` is the most commonly set scope, having scopes like `email`
allows you to match roles to individual users.

As discussed, the ability to view this basic project has been granted but
not to modify or delete it. To confirm that, try deleting the Project:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd proj delete {user}
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
FATA[0000] rpc error: code = PermissionDenied desc = permission denied: projects, delete, user1, sub: user1-cli, iat: 2024-07-30T17:14:43Z
----

As expected we were denied permission to delete the Project. Again as a reminder the Argo RBAC is only used when you interact with
Argo CD via its UI or CLI. If you have permissions on the `AppProject` kind in the Argo CD namespace you could delete the resource
with `oc delete appproject user1 -n gitops` and the Argo CD RBAC would never be checked,

This is a challenge when you want to give users the ability to declaratively manage Applications instead of managing them with the UI or CLI, fortunately
Argo CD has you covered as we will see in the next module.

=== Apps in Any Namespace

You may have noticed a subtle difference between the Cluster and Shared instancs of GitOps in that
the Application names in the shared instance are prefixed with a namespace where as the Cluster Applications
are not.

Run the following command again:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd app list
----

The following output will be provided, notice that the Application name consists of two parts using the format `<Namespace>/<Application Name>`:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME                    CLUSTER     NAMESPACE   PROJECT  STATUS  HEALTH   SYNCPOLICY  CONDITIONS  REPO                                                        PATH                              TARGET
{user}-argocd/dev-tools  in-cluster  {user}-cicd  {user}    Synced  Healthy  Auto        <none>      https://github.com/AdvancedDevSecOpsWorkshop/bootstrap.git  infra/dev-tools/overlays/default  HEAD
----

The reason why is that we are using the link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/app-any-namespace[Apps in Any Namespace,window='_blank'] feature. Traditionally,
Argo CD requires that Application resources be in the same namespace as the Argo CD installation. Apps in Any Namespace allow applications to exist in other
namespaces and is very useful when using multi-tenant Argo CD.

This is because when Applications are in the same namespace as Argo CD users cannot be allowed to declaratively manage their Application resources. if permitted to do so, they
could easily bypass the security provided by Argo CD Projects simply by assigning any Project to the Application by creating or modifying it using Kubernetes (i.e. oc apply, oc edit).
This problem arises because Argo CD RBAC is only enforced when using the Argo UI or CLI, it is not enforced by Kubernetes.

The Apps in Any Namespace feature avoids this issue by requiring the platform team to bind a specific Argo CD Project to the instance.

The namespace being included as part of the Application name is a subtle indication that Apps in Any Namespace is being used

To configure Apps in Any Namespace there are two places where the source namespaces for Applications must be configurd. The
first is as a startup parameter for the Argo CD instance, with the OpenShift GitOps operator this is the `sourceNamespaces`
field in the ArgoCD CR. Use the following command to see additional information about the field:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
oc explain argocd.spec.sourceNamespaces
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
GROUP:      argoproj.io
KIND:       ArgoCD
VERSION:    v1beta1

FIELD: sourceNamespaces <[]string>

DESCRIPTION:
    SourceNamespaces defines the namespaces application resources are allowed to
    be created in
----

This field takes an array of namespaces however wildcards can be used to reduce management effort. It is highly
recommended when considering using Apps in Any Namespace to select a naming pattern for these namespaces that
is amenable to using with wildcards.

[Note]
The intent of this recommendation is so that this field can be set once and not need to be constantly
updated as new tenants and users are on-boarded into the Shared instance.

The second place to configure `sourceNamespaces` is in the Argo CD Project. This determines which
namespaces, and correspondingly the Applications in that namespace, are associated with which Project.
This ensures that when a user creates or modifies an Application in namespace X that it is always
associated with Project Y even if the user tries to bypass security and select a different Project.

At the moment the Argo CD CLI does not support displaying the sourceNamespaces however they can be
viewed in the UI. Switch to the Argo CD UI and navigate to "Settings > Projects" and select
project {user}. You should see the sourceNamespaces defined as follows:
