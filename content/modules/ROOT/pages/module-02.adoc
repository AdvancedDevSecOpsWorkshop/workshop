= The Power of GitOps with OpenShift GitOps(60 mins)

In this module you will understand how GitOps is used to manage cluster configuration and application deployments.

== Introduction

GitOps is the process that is used to deploy and manage cluster configuration and application deployments. In GitOps, git
as the source of truth and the GitOps engine, OpenShift GitOps, reconciles what is stored in git with the state of the cluster.
This process is two-way, changes to git can be automatically reconciled to the cluster and direct, manual changes in the cluster
can be automatically reverted back to what is in git.

In this way GitOps provides a powerful way to manage state in Kubernetes clusters while addressing common issues like
configuration drift, change management and auditing.

OpenShift GitOps is provided with OpenShift at no additional cost, it provides a fully supported GitOps engine
using the upstream link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD,window='_blank'] project. Argo CD is a popular
GitOps engine for Kubernetes that provides a variety of features to manage a GitOps environment including
the engine, a comprehensive user interface, etc.

== OpenShift GitOps Architecture

In this section we will do a brief overview of the OpenShift GitOps architecture which is depicted in the diagram below.

image::gitops/argocd-architecture.png[]

In the diagram above, everything contained within the dotted is running in OpenShift whereas outside the line are external
dependencies or interactions.

The OpenShift GitOps operator is used to deploy, manage and upgrade an installation of Argo CD which runs in a
specified namespace. The Argo CD installation contains several components, running as individual deployments,
which are as follows:

1. application-controller. This component is responsible for deploying and monitoring Kubernetes resources,
as a result it interacts with the Kubernetes API.
2. repo-server. This component manages access to the manifests via a git repository, it is responsible for
fetching the manifests (i.e. yaml files). These manifests can be built from raw yaml, helm or kustomize but
additional tools can be used via a plugin architecture. For improved performance, it caches these manifests
in the redis component.
3. Server. This provides the user interface as well as a REST API.
4. Dex (optional). Provides authentication via OpenShift OAuth2, in this workshop it is not used as we
are authenticating directly against Keycloak.
5. applicationset-controller (Not shown). This component is responsible for managing ApplicationSets which
are used to generate Applications using generators. These generators can create Applications based on Pull Requests,
directories in git, clusters, etc.

== Workshop Architecture

In this workshop, two GitOps instances have been deployed as follows:

1. Cluster GitOps. This is used by the platform team to manage cluster configuration as well as
cluster-scoped tenant resources (i.e. Namespaces, Quotas, Networkpolicy, Operators, etc).

2. Shared GitOps. This instance is used by application teams to deploy their applications. This is a shared
GitOps environment with multiple application teams accessing it. As a result Argo CD Role Based Access Controls (RBAC) has been
configured to manage access so that users from different teams cannot view or modify other teams applications.

=== Cluster GitOps

By default the OpenShift GitOps operator will install an instance in the `openshift-gitops` namespace, this instance
is cluster-scoped and users are encouraged to use this instance for cluster configuraton including managing
privileged resources on behalf of tenants (Namespaces, Quotas, Operators, etc).

Lets, have a look at this instance now, to do so access the OpenShift Application Menu and select the Cluster Argo CD
item highlighted in red:

This will take you to the Argo CD user interface for this instance, to login click the Keycloak button shown in red:

image::gitops/argocd-keycloak-login.png[]

Assuming you have already logged into OpenShift with Keycloak you will be automatically logged into Argo CD since
we are using Keycloak to provide Single-Sign-On in this workshop. Once you are logged in you will see the following
applications:

Notice how you view all of the user projects (user1, user2, user3, etc), this is because we have used Argo CD RBAC
to provide users in the `developers` group with limited access to these projects.

[Note]
It is rare for developers to have access to the cluster scoped instance which is typically managed by the platform
team, we are providing it here for illustrative purposes.

You can view the groups associated with your logged in user by clicking on the user button, note the `developers`
group that is shown along with the team, `teamX`, that your user is associated with. In our scenario user1 is on
team 1, user2 on team2, etc. The `developers` group is a catch all group that all of the users belong to.

These groups are provisioned in Keycloak and made available to Argo CD when you logged into the application.

Next click on Settings and the Projects.

This will take you to the list of projects where you will see a single project called `users`. Click on `users` to view
the following tab:
