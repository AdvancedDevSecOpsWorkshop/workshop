= Prerequisites

Each module in this workshop depends on work performed in previous modules. This section
lays out the work that is required from previous modules in case you need to advance for
some reason such as not being able to complete a module due to time, technical difficulties
or the instructor running a shortened version of the workshop.

== Module 1 - OpenShift as an Application Platform

In this module participants learn how to use the OpenShift console and command line to
deploy applications. The work performed here to login into OpenShift and clone
the workshop git repository is required in all following modules.

* Access the OpenShift console here:

link:{openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url},window='_blank']

* Login into the console using the *Keycloak* provider:

[IMPORTANT]
If you accidentally login with the `htpasswd_provider` option then you will not be
able to login to OpenShift with Keycloak. Please ask your instructor
to correct it by deleting the OpenShift user and identity before logging in again
with Keycloak.

* Use the username `{user}` and password `openshift`

* In OpenShift Console you will need to click on your user name in
the upper right corner and select `Copy login command`:
