== 1. Introduction and Overview

*Welcome to the OpenShift DevSecOps Roadshow!*
In this Roadshow, you will learn the techniques and technologies for adopting https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops[DevOps^] and https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops[DevSecOps^] practices to run applications in https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[The Open Hybrid Cloud^].

== 2. Key Takeaways

* Learn how to leverage *Red Hat OpenShift*  as an *Application Platform Trusted - Comprehensive - Consistent capabilities*.
* Dive into *CI/CD* pipelines using *OpenShift Pipelines*.
* Adopt *DevSecOps* best practices securely with *OpenShift GitOps* and *Trusted Software Supply Chain*.

== 3. Environment Overview

Our cluster is provisioned just for you and this roadshow. During this day, you will be accessing the same cluster with pre-defined credentials shared in each module.

Below is a list of the technologies installed and configured in the OpenShift cluster.
