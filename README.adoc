### OpenShift Advanced DevSecOps Workshop

#### Introduction

Work-In-Progress

#### Installation

Eventually this workshop will be available in RHDP but for now it can be installed as follows:

* Provision OpenShift Workshop 4.14 instance in RHDP with the desired number of users
* Login on the command line as the `admin` user with the credentials RHDP provided
* Modify `bootstrap/bootstrap/ansible/bootstrap.yaml` to set the number of users you need, this must match the number of users selected in RHDP
* Run the command `./bootstrap/bootstrap.sh`

Note that the installation is using ansible to bootstrap GitOps onto the cluster so you must have ansible installed
on your system along with the requirements to use the ansible k8s module.

#### Troubleshooting

### Check in Cluster Argo CD that all Applications are in Sync and not Degraded

Login into the Cluster Argo CD and ensure that all Applications are Healthy and in Sync. Note that if Keycloak is down you may need to login using the
`admin` account and the password stored in the `openshift-gitops-cluster` secret.

### Certificate fails to be provisioned

If any of the certificates fail to be provisioned you can use the `cmctl` tool to request a manual renewal:

```
cmctl renew <xxxxx> -n <namespace>
```
Note you may need to restart related pods once the certificate is properly provisioned.
